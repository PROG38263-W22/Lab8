# Lab 8 - Malicious File Uploads

## Building the Lab

* git clone <a href="https://github.com/PROG38263-W21/Lab8.git">https://github.com/PROG38263-W22/Lab8.git</a>
* <code>cd Lab8/code</code>
* <code>sudo chown www-data files</code>
* <code>cd ../</code>
* <code>docker-compose build && docker-compose up</code>
* In a browser, navigate to the root directory of your virtual machine

## Malicious File Uploads

* Try uploading some images and observe the method the program uses for validation.
* Try uploading a PHP script instead of an image.
* Try navigating to the uploaded script.
* Experiment with other scripts.

## Fixing

* Modify the program to prevent malicious file uploads by enforcing more rigorous validation.
